The purpose of this app is to retrieve scientific names of plants.
User is required to enter any name of the plant, click search and should be able to get results.
Results will show the scientific name of the plant as per search as well as related plant species.
Structure of the app: I have used a form to get input and button to trigger a call to an API.A static content page accessed from "Go to page" on the form.

The project is available on Mpesa Miniprogram with below details:
